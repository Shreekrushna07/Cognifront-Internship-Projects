            <p>In 1636, the Adil Shahi sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south.[6] The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal empire.[6][31] It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.</p>

            <p>Shahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army, and Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.</p>
